# AlphaMissense_GPCRome

This repo contains heatmaps of AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores for the humna GPCRome. 

The initial paper describing AlphaMissense can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg7492 all data plotted here is from their Zenodo repo located here: https://zenodo.org/record/8208688

Uniprot was queried on September 26, 2023 for GPCR, and filtered for human results. This list of IDs was not checked, as such there are g-proteins, GRKs, and other stragglers that likely came along for the ride. 

You can search this repo for your gene name to pull up the heatmap, or look at the enclosed uniprot_seq.csv to find your gene ID and filename. 

Reach out if you find errors and I'll strive to fix.
